### Part I
Finding Donors for CharityML: In this project, I will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. I will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, I will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. I will then evaluate several supervised learners of my choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, I will optimize the model I've selected and present it as my solution to CharityML. Finally, I will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
#### Project Highlights
This project is designed to get me acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided. This notebook can be found in the file Finding_Donors.ipynb.  
  
Things I learned by completing this project:
- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.
### Part II
Identify Customer Segments: In this project, I will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that I will use represents a real-life data science task. The notebook for this section is Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb.
